                    <h2>Understanding Life Transitions</h2>
                    <p>Life transitions are significant changes that alter your daily routine, roles, or identity. They can be positive, like the birth of a child, or challenging, like the loss of a loved one. Understanding the nature of these transitions is crucial for managing them effectively.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Types of Transitions:</strong> Developmental (e.g., aging), situational (e.g., moving), and health-related (e.g., illness).</li>
                        <li><strong>Common Triggers:</strong> Career changes, relocation, parenthood, retirement, and loss.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emotional Responses:</strong> Transitions often evoke a range of emotions, from excitement and hope to anxiety and grief.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Impact of Life Transitions on Relationships</h2>
                    <p>Life transitions can strain relationships, but they can also strengthen them if navigated well. The key lies in how couples communicate and support each other during these times.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Transitions are not just individual experiences; they are relational ones. How couples handle them together can either deepen their bond or create distance."</p>
                        <footer>— Dr. Susan Johnson, Relationship Expert</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Understanding the dual nature of transitions—their potential to disrupt and to deepen—is crucial for couples navigating change.</p>

                        <li><strong>Schedule Regular Check-ins:</strong> Set aside time to discuss your transitions and how you can support each other.</li>
