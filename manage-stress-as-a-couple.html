                    <p>Stress is an inevitable part of life, but its impact on relationships can vary widely. Understanding the nature of stress and how it manifests in your relationship is the first step toward managing it effectively.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Types of Stress:</strong> Acute stress, episodic acute stress, and chronic stress each have different effects on individuals and relationships.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stress Triggers:</strong> Common triggers include financial difficulties, health issues, work pressures, and family conflicts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stress Responses:</strong> People respond to stress differently—some may become withdrawn, while others may become irritable or anxious.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Impact of Stress on Couples</h2>
                    <p>Stress can strain even the most resilient relationships. It can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and emotional distance. However, it can also be an opportunity for growth if managed well.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Stress is not just an individual experience; it's a relational one. How couples handle stress together can either strengthen or weaken their bond."</p>
                        <footer>— Dr. John Gottman, Relationship Expert</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Understanding the dual nature of stress—its potential to harm and to heal—is crucial for couples navigating challenging times.</p>
